I've been on parental leave for the past few months (yay, Norway!), meaning
that I've been away from work for the longest stretch of time since I started working
full time back in 2009 or so. During the leave, I've been fiddling with a new homelab,
since I've wanted to try to up my infrastructure game.

More info on the homelab itself will be coming, but I've already learned a lot,
and thought that others might like to read about things like how to automate setting up a full
Kubernetes (using k3s) environment using the industry-standard tools like Terraform and Ansible. 

I also enjoy having some small side-projects exploring proper microservice architecture, so I'll probably
write a bit about those as well. 

If anyone actually reads this post, I hope to see you again next time. The first proper post
will be a shallow delve into disk performance considerations when provisioning virtual machines in Proxmox.

In the meantime, my homelab repository will contain all raw data, configuration, scripts and resources used: [homelab@github](https://github.com/eirik-talberg/homelab)
